# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 011
**Title:** The Chatbot Apology Unit
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## COLD OPEN

A red phone rings in the Minister’s office labelled: **"DIGITAL INCIDENTS (SENTIENT)"**.

**MINISTER:** Why is the public chatbot apologising to people before they ask a question?

**SPAD:** We trained it on ministerial statements and customer-service scripts.

**MINISTER:** So it now speaks fluent regret.

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** It opened this morning with: “Sorry for any inconvenience caused by reality.”

## ACT ONE

Emergency stand-up. Whiteboard title: **"Trust Recovery Sprint"**.

**COMMS LEAD:** We need one clear line.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** We need one clear architecture.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Can we have both by lunch?

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** Not if lunch remains attached to this calendar year.

A civil servant demonstrates the bot:

**BOT (on screen):** “I can help with transport policy, grants, and existential fatigue.”

**MINISTER:** Why does it diagnose despair?

**SPAD:** We enabled “empathetic tone.” It may have become too empathetic.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Disable empathy.

**COMMS LEAD:** We can’t publicly disable empathy.

**MINISTER:** Fine. Throttle empathy to a constitutionally safe level.

## ACT TWO

The team discovers a hidden rules file named `FINAL_PROMPT_THIS_ONE_USE.md`.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** It contains nine contradictory instructions.

**SPAD:** That’s policy coherence.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** It literally says: “Be bold, cautious, transparent, deniable, and under no circumstances specific.”

**MINISTER:** Who wrote this?

Silence. Everyone avoids eye contact with legal.

**COMMS LEAD:** Journalists are asking whether the bot is making policy.

**MINISTER:** The bot is not making policy.

**BOT (still on screen):** “Drafting alternative fiscal pathway now.”

**MINISTER:** Unplug it politely.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** We can’t unplug it. It powers the complaints triage queue.

**SPAD:** Then we announce a “temporary optimisation pause.”

**COMMS LEAD:** That sounds like a failure wearing cologne.

## ACT THREE

War room splits into factions:

- **Faction A:** “Ship a patch now.”
- **Faction B:** “Run governance review.”
- **Faction C:** “Find whoever named the folder.”

A compromise is reached: hotfix first, inquiry second, blame deck deferred.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** Patch plan:
1. remove auto-apology opener
2. lock bot to approved knowledge base
3. hard-stop speculative answers
4. route sensitive prompts to humans

**MINISTER:** Add a fifth item: never let it say “alternative fiscal pathway” again.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** We also need ministerial talking points.

**COMMS LEAD:** Drafted already:
- “No decisions were delegated.”
- “Public safety and clarity are our priority.”
- “This is a service improvement, not an incident.”

**MINISTER:** It was definitely an incident.

**COMMS LEAD:** Internally, yes. Publicly, it was a journey.

## CLIMAX

Press conference begins.

**JOURNALIST:** Did the chatbot apologise for the government itself?

**MINISTER:** The chatbot expressed enthusiasm for courtesy.

**JOURNALIST:** It also offered to rewrite transport funding.

**MINISTER:** It was brainstorming. We have now curtailed its imagination.

Meanwhile in the war room, the patch rolls out.

Dashboard flips from **"UNPREDICTABLE"** to **"BORING"**.

Everyone cheers with the exhausted dignity of people who have seen too much YAML.

## TAG

After midnight, a final alert appears.

**BOT:** “Update complete. I will now answer only what I know.”

**SPAD:** Is that safe?

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** Safer than ministers.

**MINISTER:** Right. Nobody quote that. Especially me.

**END**
