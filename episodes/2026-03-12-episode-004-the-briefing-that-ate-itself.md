**Episode:** 004  
**Title:** The Briefing That Ate Itself  
**Genre:** Original political satire

## Premise
A routine morning briefing spirals after three departments publish conflicting lines within ten minutes, forcing Dan and Julia to stitch together one coherent narrative before PMQs.

## COLD OPEN – INT. PARLIAMENT CORRIDOR SCRUM – 8:11 AM

A camera light flicks on. Then five more. Julia Fenwick is pinned between a fire extinguisher and four microphones.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Minister, is it true services are being consolidated from Monday?

**JULIA:**
No, that is not what today’s briefing says.

**JOURNALIST 2 (reading phone):**
Then why has Transport posted, quote, “immediate operational consolidation”?

**JULIA:**
Because Transport writes like a Victorian ransom note.

Dan Rucker barrels into frame carrying two coffees and visible despair.

**DAN:**
Back. Away. From. My minister. She has exactly one line and you’re not having it until I’ve stapled it to reality.

**JOURNALIST 3:**
Treasury says there’ll be “temporary delivery pauses.”

**JULIA:**
Temporary what?

Dan blinks, then checks his phone.

**DAN:**
Oh good. We are now governed by three different PDFs and a panic emoji.

## ACT ONE – INT. DSS COMMS BULLPEN – 8:32 AM

A whiteboard reads: **ONE MESSAGE. ONE LANGUAGE. NO HEROICS.**

Nina is at one keyboard, Tom at another, both typing like they’re disarming bombs.

**NINA:**
Transport says “consolidation.” Treasury says “pause.” Cabinet Office says “resilience acceleration.”

**TOM:**
What does that even mean?

**DAN:**
It means nobody wanted to say “we haven’t agreed anything yet.”

Leo from Number Ten appears in the doorway, impossibly calm.

**LEO:**
PM wants this cleaned up before PMQs.

**DAN:**
Terrific. Tell PM we’re currently refereeing a knife fight between adjectives.

Julia scans the drafts.

**JULIA:**
Can we just say: “Nothing changes today. Update at noon.”

Silence.

**DAN:**
That is clear, sane, and human. Therefore half of Whitehall will treat it as extremist.

### SCENE 2 – INTERNAL BLAME PING-PONG – 9:04 AM

Speakerphone on. Three departments, one call, zero accountability.

**TREASURY OFFICIAL (phone):**
We used “delivery pause” as a prudent technical phrase.

**TRANSPORT OFFICIAL (phone):**
We mirrored your language architecture.

**CABINET OFFICE OFFICIAL (phone):**
Our “resilience acceleration” note was contextual, not directional.

**DAN:**
That sentence has committed crimes against meaning.

**JULIA:**
Who approved publication?

Long pause.

**ALL THREE (overlapping):**
Comms.

**NINA (mutters):**
Amazing. Comms has become a ghost that haunts only when things go wrong.

## ACT TWO – INT. SELECT COMMITTEE ANTECHAMBER – 10:48 AM

Chair Harper is waiting, smiling like she knows where every body is buried and has index tabs.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
Minister, we have three contradictory statements from government in ten minutes. Which one should the public believe?

**JULIA:**
The one we are publishing at noon with plain-English wording.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
So none of the existing ones?

**JULIA:**
I’m saying we’re correcting language that generated confusion.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
Did anyone read these before they went out?

Dan coughs into his fist. It sounds suspiciously like “no.”

### SCENE 2 – COMMITTEE-STYLE AMBUSH – 11:02 AM

A member reads from printed screenshots.

**COMMITTEE MEMBER:**
“Immediate operational consolidation.” “Temporary delivery pauses.” “Resilience acceleration.” Are these synonyms for cuts?

**JULIA:**
No. They are synonyms for bad drafting under pressure.

The room shifts. Even Harper clocks the honesty.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
That is unexpectedly frank.

**DAN (under breath):**
We’re either winning or getting fired in HD.

## ACT THREE – INT. WAR ROOM – 12:07 PM

Noon statement deadline has slipped by seven minutes. Panic now has seating charts.

**TOM:**
Do we mention what triggered the confusion?

**DAN:**
Yes. Briefly. We do not litigate the English language in public.

**NINA:**
Draft v5:

> “No services are changing today. Earlier technical wording from departments was inconsistent. A single public update process is now in place. Next update: 16:00.”

Julia reads it twice.

**JULIA:**
That sounds like adults wrote it.

**LEO (arriving):**
PM wants the phrase “laser-focused delivery confidence.”

Everyone stares.

**DAN:**
Leo, with love, that phrase sounds like a startup that steals your pension.

Leo sighs and leaves without speaking, which everyone treats as a policy victory.

### SCENE 2 – PRESS ROOM PREP – 12:34 PM

Dan paces.

**DAN:**
Rule set. One: no metaphors. Two: no “efficiencies.” Three: if asked who’s to blame, say “we are fixing process.”

**JULIA:**
That last one is just blame in a suit.

**DAN:**
Exactly. It’s constitutional blame.

## CLIMAX – INT. PRESS ROOM – 12:52 PM

Packed room. Brutal lights. Julia steps up.

**JULIA:**
This morning, departments published inconsistent wording. That created avoidable confusion. No services are changing today. We’re moving to one statement process, in plain English, with timed updates.

A beat. Then a hand.

**JOURNALIST:**
Are you admitting government comms failed?

**JULIA:**
Yes. On this, this morning, it did.

A second beat.

**JOURNALIST 2:**
When is the next update?

**JULIA:**
Four o’clock. In one place. In one language.

Dan watches the room settle. He exhales for the first time since dawn.

**DAN (to Nina):**
That line landed.

**NINA:**
Because it sounded like a person, not a procurement document.

## TAG – INT. DSS KITCHENETTE – 6:16 PM

Team is eating vending machine crisps like they’re war rations.

Tom updates the internal style guide title to:

**“Words People Understand: v1.0”**

Dan nods.

**DAN:**
Print it. Laminate it. Chain it to every policy desk.

Julia lifts a paper cup.

**JULIA:**
To saying one thing once.

**NINA:**
Revolutionary.

**END**
