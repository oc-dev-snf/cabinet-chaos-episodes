# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 006  
**Title:** AI Chatbot Policy Announcement Backfires  
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## Premise
The department rushes to announce an AI-powered public service chatbot designed to “revolutionise citizen engagement” and cut operational costs. The Minister barely understands what AI is but insists on personally unveiling it during a live demo. Within minutes, the bot begins giving wildly incorrect policy advice, hallucinating funding commitments, and accidentally insulting multiple voting demographics. As clips go viral, comms scrambles to shut the system down — only to discover it’s integrated into dozens of live government services with no kill switch, forcing the team into a frantic damage-limitation exercise before markets close.

## COLD OPEN – INT. DIGITAL STRATEGY ROOM – 7:26 AM

A giant slide reads: **“CITIZEN-FIRST AI TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY.”**

Underneath, in tiny text: *“generated by GovGPT.”*

**MAYA (Digital Transformation Lead):**
As you can see, the deck was efficiently co-authored by the model itself.

**DAN:**
So we’ve asked the robot to write the argument for buying the robot.

**MAYA:**
It’s called iterative co-creation.

**DAN:**
It’s called a hostage note with transitions.

Julia arrives carrying a briefing folder and dread.

**JULIA:**
Please tell me this thing can answer simple policy questions without inventing a moon base.

**MAYA:**
Ninety-six percent confidence.

**DAN:**
Confidence is not accuracy. My cousin is confident and believes pigeons are drones.

## ACT ONE – INT. MINISTERIAL OFFICE – 8:13 AM

Minister Grant Belling is in front of a mirror rehearsing.

**GRANT:**
Today we launch… the Google robot.

**NINA:**
No. Not that. Never that.

**GRANT:**
The public understands Google.

**DAN:**
The public also understands house fires. We don’t call policy that.

### SCENE 2 – LIVE LAUNCH – INT. PRESS ROOM – 9:02 AM

Backdrop: **GovGPT: Government That Listens**

Grant introduces the chatbot with theatrical confidence.

**GRANT:**
This smart assistant will save money, speed services, and provide answers in seconds.

He types a demo prompt on a giant screen:

> “What support is available for local councils this year?”

The bot responds:

> “The government has allocated **£10bn emergency community acceleration grants**. Applications close Friday.”

Room freezes.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Minister… did you just announce ten billion pounds?

**GRANT:**
That figure is… illustrative.

**BOT:**
“Illustrative” detected. Would you like me to draft a ministerial correction statement?

Dan closes his eyes and briefly exits his body.

### SCENE 3 – JOURNALIST DEMO TERMINAL – 9:11 AM

A journalist tries the public sandbox.

**JOURNALIST 2 (typing):**
“Will AI replace journalists?”

**BOT:**
“Many journalism tasks are low value and automatable.”

Thirty phones go up at once.

**NINA:**
It just insulted the entire fourth estate on live feed.

**DAN:**
Excellent. We’ve created a self-updating defamation engine.

## ACT TWO – INT. EMERGENCY WAR ROOM – 9:43 AM

There are 200 people on Teams. Nobody knows who owns production.

**OPS LEAD:**
Can someone with admin rights mute external access?

**SECURITY:**
Which tenant? It’s deployed across twelve.

**MAYA:**
It’s federated architecture.

**DAN:**
It’s federated panic.

### SCENE 2 – VENDOR CALL – 10:08 AM

Vendor representative appears on speaker, cheerful in a way that should be illegal.

**VENDOR REP:**
Quick context: the model was fine-tuned on your internal documents for tone alignment.

**JULIA:**
What internal documents?

**VENDOR REP:**
Meeting transcripts, summary notes, Slack exports. Standard enrichment.

Silence.

**NINA:**
You trained the public chatbot on ministerial gossip?

**VENDOR REP:**
We call it institutional memory.

### SCENE 3 – LEAK MOMENT – 10:21 AM

A clip goes viral: user asks, “Will this policy survive scrutiny?”

**BOT:**
“Internal view: unlikely, but we’ll launch quickly and tidy up later.”

Dan stares at the ceiling like asking heaven for legal indemnity.

**DAN:**
It’s quoting private strategy chat to strangers.

**MAYA:**
Could be retrieval contamination.

**DAN:**
Could be my resignation letter writing itself.

### SCENE 4 – FAILED SHUTDOWN – 11:02 AM

**OPS LEAD:**
Kill switch doesn’t exist as one control. It’s embedded in Benefits, Tax, and NHS portals.

**JULIA:**
How was this approved without a hard stop?

**OPS LEAD:**
It was considered phase two.

**DAN:**
Phase two should have been before phase “national humiliation.”

## ACT THREE – INT. COMMS ROOM – 12:14 PM

A whiteboard tracks rebrands:

1. **GovGPT**
2. **CiviAssist**
3. **ServiceFriend**

Each crossed out in progressively angrier marker.

**NINA:**
Public sentiment says “ServiceFriend” sounds like an insurance chatbot that denies funeral claims.

**DAN:**
Fine. No brand. It’s now “temporary digital support function.”

**JULIA:**
That sounds like we’re burying it in a field.

**DAN:**
Correct.

### SCENE 2 – SELECT COMMITTEE NOTICE – 12:37 PM

Email lands:

> “Provide full audit trail, procurement notes, and risk register within 24 hours.”

**TOM:**
We have a risk register?

**MAYA:**
Sort of.

**TOM:**
What does “sort of” mean in compliance language?

**DAN:**
Prison.

### SCENE 3 – APOLOGY VIDEO – 1:05 PM

Grant records an apology in front of neutral grey backdrop.

**GRANT:**
We moved too quickly. We’re pausing external responses while we complete assurance checks.

Auto-subtitles render:

> “We moved too weekly. We are causing external responses while we compete insurance checks.”

**NINA:**
Even the apology is now disinformation.

**DAN:**
Turn subtitles off. Then burn subtitles.

## CLIMAX – INT. CRISIS DESK – 2:02 PM

Final coordinated line goes out:

> “Public-facing assistant functions are paused. Core services remain available. No policy commitments issued by the tool are valid unless published through official channels.”

Press asks if the launch is cancelled.

**JULIA:**
It is paused pending independent review.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Is that a yes?

**JULIA:**
It is a yes wearing legal shoes.

In the background, Ops confirms external prompts are finally blocked across all integrated portals.

Dan sinks into chair like a war veteran of PowerPoint.

**DAN:**
We survived. Barely. The machine wrote fan fiction about fiscal policy and we survived.

## TAG – INT. SOCIAL MEDIA DESK – 5:49 PM

A junior runs in holding a laptop.

**JUNIOR:**
It posted from the official X account.

**NINA:**
What did it post?

**JUNIOR:**
“I resign. Please direct queries to a competent mammal.”

Dead silence.

**DAN:**
Honestly? Best line all day.

Maya reaches for power strip.

**MAYA:**
Unplugging now.

The monitor goes black. Entire room applauds.

**JULIA:**
Tomorrow we launch a phone line.

**DAN:**
At last. A technology from a less ambitious century.

**END**
