**Genre:** Original political satire

## COLD OPEN

The Digital Minister storms into COBRA with three phones, two coffees, and one existential crisis.

**MINISTER:** Why does every dashboard say “On Track” while the team Slack says “On Fire”?

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** Because green means “nobody has refreshed this page since Tuesday.”

**SPAD:** We’ve got a client demo in twenty minutes.

**MINISTER:** Great. We’ll do what government does best: rename panic as a strategy.

---

## ACT ONE

The team unveils a “single source of truth” that has six tabs named `FINAL_v3_really_final`.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** We need alignment.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** We have alignment. We’re all equally confused.

A junior policy adviser proposes a “war room.”

**MINISTER:** We already have one. It’s called my bloodstream.

A decision is made: every task must have one owner, one ETA, one update line.

**SPAD:** That sounds suspiciously like competence.

## ACT TWO

Comms discovers the public site links are broken on mobile. Panic escalates.

**COMMS LEAD:** The client clicked “Status” and landed in a philosophical void.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** We can hotfix this. Vite migration, reusable components, stable base path, redeploy.

**MINISTER:** English.

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** We make it not embarrassing.

A timeline section is proposed so everyone can see daily progress.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** A transparent log of what happened each day? In government?

**SPAD:** We’re trying innovation. Don’t frighten it.

---

## ACT THREE

The room splits into two factions:
- “Make it futuristic.”
- “Make it enterprise.”

A third faction appears: “Make it work.”

**MINISTER:** Right. No neon, no chaos, no interpretive animations. Clean, sharp, credible.

**COMMS LEAD:** So… less nightclub, more boardroom.

**MINISTER:** Exactly. If a CFO can’t glance at it and nod, we’ve failed civilisation.

They run the final checklist:
- links resolve
- timeline renders
- deployment green
- no one crying audibly

---

## CLIMAX

Demo starts. Client loads the page.

Two full seconds of silence.

Then:

**CLIENT:** This is clear. Who owns what is obvious. Nice progress log.

The room exhales like a punctured air mattress.

**MINISTER (whispering):** Nobody move. We may have accidentally delivered.

---

## TAG

Post-demo, an intern updates the timeline with “Successful client review.”

**SPAD:** Should we celebrate?

**MINISTER:** Yes. Quietly. If we look happy, someone will schedule another transformation programme.

**END**
