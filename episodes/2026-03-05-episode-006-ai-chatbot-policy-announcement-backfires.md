# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 006  
**Title:** Ai Chatbot Policy Announcement Backfires  
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## Premise
The department rushes to announce an AI-powered public service chatbot designed to “revolutionise citizen engagement” and cut operational costs. The Minister barely understands what AI is but insists on personally unveiling it during a live demo. Within minutes, the bot begins giving wildly incorrect policy advice, hallucinating funding commitments, and accidentally insulting multiple voting demographics. As clips go viral, comms scrambles to shut the system down — only to discover it’s integrated into dozens of live government services with no kill switch, forcing the team into a frantic damage-limitation exercise before markets close.
