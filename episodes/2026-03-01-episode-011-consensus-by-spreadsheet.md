## COLD OPEN

A ministerial strategy meeting begins with confidence, pastries, and absolutely no strategy.

**MINISTER:** Right, team. Today we deliver one clear position.

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** Excellent. We currently have nine clear positions.

**POLICY LEAD:** Ten, if you count the one legal says we never had.

A projector flickers on, showing a spreadsheet titled `national-message-final-final-actual.xlsx`.

**COMMS DIRECTOR:** Why does column C say “official line (morning)” and column D say “official line (if challenged)”?

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** Because reality is now a two-shift operation.

## ACT ONE

The department launches a “Rapid Alignment Taskforce,” immediately divided into three subgroups:
- strategy
- delivery
- a subgroup to define what “alignment” means

**MINISTER:** We need a simple framework.

**OPERATIONS HEAD:** We have one. It has twelve stages and a legend.

**MINISTER:** That’s not simple.

**OPERATIONS HEAD:** It is if you ignore stages four through nine.

A special adviser suggests appointing a “single source of truth owner.”

**POLICY LEAD:** We tried that. Three people volunteered and each brought a different source.

---

## ACT TWO

A cross-government call is convened to settle the policy wording.

**CABINET OFFICE REP:** We need language that is firm, flexible, and impossible to misinterpret.

**LEGAL ADVISER:** Those goals are in active conflict.

**COMMS DIRECTOR:** Could we aim for “politely definite”?

**LEGAL ADVISER:** Legally, that means nothing.

A new compromise draft appears every two minutes.

Draft 14: too vague.  
Draft 15: too bold.  
Draft 16: accidentally reads like a weather warning.

**MINISTER:** Why does this sentence include “subject to atmospheric conditions”?

**POLICY LEAD:** Copied from transport guidance by mistake.

---

## ACT THREE

With an hour to go, the team tries a decision matrix.

Rows: policy options.  
Columns: feasibility, cost, legal risk, headline risk, ministerial appetite.

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** Great. Which option wins?

**ANALYST:** Depends on the weighting.

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** Set sensible weightings.

**ANALYST:** Everyone has a different definition of sensible.

They test three weightings:
- “Prudent” selects Option B.
- “Ambitious” selects Option D.
- “Please survive the news cycle” selects Option A with caveats.

**MINISTER:** Is there a weighting called “gets us through tomorrow with dignity”?

**ANALYST:** Not yet, but I can add a tab.

## CLIMAX

Minutes before the press briefing, the Permanent Secretary enters holding a single printed page.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Here is the final line. One sentence. Agreed by policy, legal, comms, and delivery.

The room goes silent.

**MINISTER (reading):** “The government will proceed carefully, quickly, and in consultation, with immediate next steps to be set out shortly.”

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** It says everything and nothing.

**COMMS DIRECTOR:** Which, in fairness, is the broadest possible consensus.

**MINISTER:** Fine. Ship it.

## TAG

Later that night, an intern updates the shared drive:

`national-message-final-final-actual-v2-USE-THIS-ONE.xlsx`

A minute later, another file appears:

`national-message-final-final-actual-v2-USE-THIS-ONE(1).xlsx`

**INTERN:** Should I delete the duplicate?

**CHIEF OF STAFF:** No. In this building, duplicates are governance.

**END**
