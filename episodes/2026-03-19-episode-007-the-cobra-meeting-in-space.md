# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 007  
**Title:** The COBRA Meeting In Space  
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## Premise
After a week of compounding policy failures, Number Ten launches a surreal “strategic reassurance exercise” involving a temporary orbital command narrative to project national resilience. Departments are told to coordinate emergency communications from a mock “space operations cell,” except nobody knows whether it is a drill, a rebrand, or an actual policy announcement. As ministers ad-lib science fiction into live interviews, Dan and Julia race to stop government from accidentally creating a constitutional crisis with a PowerPoint planet animation.

## COLD OPEN – INT. CABINET OFFICE BASEMENT – 6:58 AM

A projector displays Earth spinning with the caption: **“COBRA ORBITAL RESPONSE MODE.”**

**DAN:**
Why is Whitehall pretending to be NASA on a Thursday?

**LEO:**
PM wants “altitude in the narrative.”

**JULIA:**
Altitude?

**LEO:**
Literally. We’re piloting an orbital command language framework.

**DAN:**
We can’t run a train timetable and now we’re doing geostationary vibes.

---

## ACT ONE – INT. MOCK CRISIS SUITE – 8:04 AM

Civil servants wear lanyards labeled **MISSION DESK**.

**NINA:**
Is this an exercise or a real operation?

**OPS DIRECTOR:**
It is a live simulation with optional policy outputs.

**DAN:**
That sentence should be illegal.

### SCENE 2 – MEDIA ROUND DISASTER – 8:31 AM

Grant Belling appears on breakfast TV.

**HOST:**
Minister, are you currently operating government from orbit?

**GRANT:**
We are adopting a higher strategic altitude.

**HOST:**
So… yes?

**GRANT:**
We have not ruled out low-earth governance modalities.

Ticker appears: **“MINISTER FLOATS ORBITAL GOVERNMENT OPTION.”**

**NINA (watching clip):**
He’s invented constitutional astronomy.

---

## ACT TWO – INT. WAR ROOM – 9:42 AM

Three departments release contradictory maps.

- Treasury: “Fiscal Gravity Stabilisation Zone”  
- Transport: “Orbital Corridor for Priority Logistics”  
- Health: “No NHS Services Have Been Launched Into Space”

**DAN:**
Amazing. We’ve reached peak Britain: interdepartmental satire as official policy.

### SCENE 2 – COBRA CALL – 10:18 AM

A siren sound plays accidentally from someone’s Teams notification.

**CHAIR (audio):**
Item one: Is the public under the impression ministers are in orbit?

**TOM:**
Polling says 34% think yes, 29% think no, 37% think “depends on weather.”

**JULIA:**
We need one line now.

**DAN:**
Fine: “No one is in space. This is a planning drill. Essential services are normal.”

**LEO:**
PM prefers “planetary resilience posture.”

**DAN:**
PM can prefer silence.

---

## ACT THREE – INT. SELECT COMMITTEE – 12:06 PM

Chair Harper holds up a printed government slide deck with stars and laser beams.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
Minister, why does this page say “Phase 2: Cabinet In Orbit”?

**GRANT:**
A metaphor.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
Then why is there a procurement line for “zero-gravity media pods”?

**GRANT:**
Forward-looking metaphor.

Dan grips a pen so hard it nearly becomes dust.

### SCENE 2 – THE LEAK – 12:44 PM

A memo drops online:

> “In event of terrestrial narrative degradation, escalate to exo-atmospheric framing.”

**NINA:**
That sounds like we leave Earth when polling dips.

**DAN:**
At this point I’d support that for selected individuals.

### SCENE 3 – PRESS MELTDOWN – 1:15 PM

Five versions of statement are queued:

1. “No orbital deployment”  
2. “No current orbital deployment”  
3. “No orbital deployment beyond planning assumptions”  
4. “No comment on orbital hypotheticals”  
5. “United Kingdom remains ground-based”

**JULIA:**
Send number five.

**DAN:**
Yes. Short, true, and blessedly terrestrial.

## CLIMAX – INT. PRESS ROOM – 2:02 PM

Julia steps up.

**JULIA:**
Today’s “orbital” language was part of an internal planning exercise and should never have entered public comms. Government remains fully ground-based. No services are changing. We are simplifying crisis language with immediate effect.

A journalist shouts:

**JOURNALIST:**
Can you guarantee there are no space ministers?

**JULIA:**
I can guarantee all ministers are currently within normal atmospheric limits.

The room laughs. Tension breaks.

Dan mutters to Nina:

**DAN:**
We’ve reached the point where “gravity” is now a policy reassurance.

---

## TAG – INT. BASEMENT STORAGE – 6:11 PM

The “COBRA ORBITAL” backdrop is being folded away.

**TOM:**
What do we do with this kit?

**DAN:**
Archive it under “Never Again.”

Nina sticks a label on the crate:

**“Strategic Props – DO NOT REDEPLOY.”**

Leo walks in with a new folder.

**LEO:**
PM wants to discuss “underwater governance narratives.”

Dan stares into middle distance.

**DAN:**
I’m taking annual leave until oxygen stops being optional.

**END**
