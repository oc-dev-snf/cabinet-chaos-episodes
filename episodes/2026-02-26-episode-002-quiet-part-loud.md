## COLD OPEN – INT. MINISTERIAL CAR – 7:18 AM

**MINISTER JULIA FENWICK** is on radio doing soft reassurance. Driver hits a pothole.

**RADIO HOST (speaker):**
So can you guarantee no service cuts this year?

**JULIA:**
We are reviewing efficiencies while protecting front-line outcomes—

**DAN RUCKER (hissed, from passenger seat):**
Don’t say efficiencies. It means cuts in a tie.

**JULIA:**
—while protecting services people rely on.

Phone buzzes. Dan checks and swears at a volume that breaks weather apps.

**DAN:**
Brilliant. Treasury leak says we’re modelling “citizen self-service migration.”

**JULIA:**
That sounds… fine?

**DAN:**
That sounds like “do it yourself government.”

## ACT ONE

### SCENE 1 – INT. DSS WAR ROOM – 8:02 AM

Whiteboard reads: **“DO NOT SAY CUTS.”**
Underneath: **“ALSO DO NOT SAY EFFICIENCIES.”**

**TOM:**
What are we allowed to say?

**DAN:**
“Smarter delivery.”

**NINA:**
That means cuts.

**DAN:**
Yes, but politely. We are a democracy, not a hostage video.

Leo from Number Ten barges in with a grin you could invoice for.

**LEO:**
PM wants a flagship phrase by lunch.

**DAN:**
Try “less for everyone.” Saves ink.

### SCENE 2 – INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM – 9:31 AM

Julia at podium. Dan lurking behind cameras like a gothic gargoyle.

**JOURNALIST:**
Will this plan reduce staff numbers?

**JULIA:**
We are modernising operations to improve resilience.

**JOURNALIST:**
That’s a yes with makeup.

**JULIA:**
That is a no to unplanned disruption.

**JOURNALIST:**
So a planned disruption?

Dan closes his eyes and silently leaves his body.

## ACT TWO

### SCENE 3 – INT. COMMS OFFICE – 11:12 AM

Social clip goes viral: “planned disruption.”
Hashtag: **#ThanksForTheDisruption**

**NINA:**
People are posting photos of broken bus stops with your quote.

**DAN:**
Excellent. We’re now a meme with pension liabilities.

**TOM:**
Could we do a corrective thread?

**DAN:**
Thread? A thread is where nuance goes to die in public.

### SCENE 4 – INT. NUMBER TEN SIDE ROOM – 12:27 PM

Leo reveals PM’s new slogan board:
- “Lean State, Strong Future”
- “Do Less, Better”
- “Nation as a Service”

**DAN:**
“Nation as a Service” sounds like you can cancel Britain monthly.

**LEO:**
PM likes innovation language.

**DAN:**
PM likes words that sound expensive and mean layoffs.

## ACT THREE

### SCENE 5 – INT. SELECT COMMITTEE – 2:04 PM

Chair Harper is smiling, which is always bad.

**CHAIR:**
Minister, is “self-service migration” a euphemism for withdrawing support?

**JULIA:**
No. It is a redesign to reduce friction.

**CHAIR:**
For users or Treasury?

Beat.

**JULIA:**
Both.

Dan nearly applauds and nearly dies.

### SCENE 6 – INT. STAIRWELL – 3:01 PM

**DAN:**
You can’t say “both.”

**JULIA:**
Why not? It’s true.

**DAN:**
Truth is seasoning, not the main course!

**JULIA:**
Maybe this place would function if we stopped speaking entirely in fog.

Dan pauses, then nods reluctantly.

**DAN:**
Fine. We do one honest line. One. Then back to controlled ambiguity.

---

## CLIMAX – INT. PRESS ROOM – 4:22 PM

**JULIA:**
Some processes will change. Some support channels will shift. We are keeping critical services, and we’ll publish what changes before anything moves.

Room stills.

**JOURNALIST:**
So no surprise cuts?

**JULIA:**
No surprises. If it changes, you’ll see it in writing.

Dan whispers to Nina:

**DAN:**
That’s either the start of trust or the start of my unemployment.

---

## TAG – INT. OPEN PLAN – 6:09 PM

Team eating stale wraps.

**TOM:**
Public response is… cautiously positive.

**NINA:**
People liked “no surprises.”

**DAN:**
Great. We’ve discovered the radical power of not lying like a malfunctioning printer.

**END**
