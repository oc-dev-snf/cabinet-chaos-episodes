**Title:** Minister Pedal Power Green Transport Gaffe  
**Genre:** Original political satire

## Premise
Following a government push on “active travel,” the Minister announces a flagship cycling infrastructure initiative intended to win over younger voters and urban commuters. Unfortunately, he hasn’t ridden a bike in 25 years, doesn’t understand how cycle lanes work, and accidentally insults both motorists and cyclists in the same morning broadcast round. As the department scrambles to spin the narrative, a pilot launch in Edinburgh descends into chaos when the Minister’s staged cycle commute goes catastrophically wrong — all while a funding shortfall and leaked WhatsApp messages threaten to derail the policy before lunchtime.
