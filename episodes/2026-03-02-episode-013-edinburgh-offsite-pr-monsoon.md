# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 013
**Title:** Edinburgh Offsite: PR in the Rain
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## COLD OPEN

Rain lashes a converted townhouse in Edinburgh where the department has booked an “offsite PR reset day.” Every umbrella outside is inside out.

**MINISTER:** Why is the weather briefing thicker than the policy pack?

**SPAD:** Because the weather is currently delivering.

A flipchart reads: **"NARRATIVE SPRING CLEAN"**. Water drips steadily onto the word “trust.”

**COMMS LEAD:** Right. Today we align voice, rebuild confidence, and stop sounding like a warning label.

A clap of thunder cuts the lights for half a second.

**MINISTER:** Is that in the agenda?

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** No, but it tested very well in authenticity workshops.

---

## ACT ONE

The offsite opens with an exercise titled **"Tell the Story Before the Story Tells You"**.

**FACILITATOR:** In one sentence: what does the public need to hear?

**MINISTER:** Competence.

**SPAD:** Stability.

**COMMS LEAD:** Humanity.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Fewer adjectives.

A junior aide wheels in pastries and three emergency dehumidifiers.

**AIDE:** Media are outside already.

**MINISTER:** Outside where?

**AIDE:** All around. We booked a glass venue.

The first draft press line appears on screen:

> “Today’s strategic retreat demonstrates agile humility in dynamic conditions.”

**MINISTER:** That sounds like we fell in a canal.

**COMMS LEAD:** It sounds modern.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** It sounds litigable.

---

## ACT TWO

A breakout session on “authentic comms” collapses when someone leaks a photo of the team wearing branded rain ponchos that say **"CLARITY SQUAD"**.

**SPAD:** It’s trending.

**MINISTER:** Positively?

**SPAD:** It depends how you feel about the phrase “state-funded improv troupe.”

Crisis huddle.

**COMMS LEAD:** We need to own this.

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** We should contextualise this.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** We should stop generating more context.

A fresh proposal lands:

- no jargon
- no staging photos
- one spokesperson
- one sentence per answer
- no “journey” metaphors

**MINISTER:** Finally. Something that reads like adulthood.

Then legal enters with a red folder.

**LEGAL ADVISER:** Small note. The venue’s livestream auto-posted your “private authenticity workshop.”

Silence.

**SPAD:** Define “auto-posted.”

**LEGAL ADVISER:** With captions.

---

## ACT THREE

Damage control becomes a masterclass in coordinated understatement.

**COMMS LEAD:** New line: “We held a routine planning meeting.”

**JOURNALIST (text alert):** “Routine planning meeting in matching ponchos?”

**MINISTER:** Fine. Revised line: “A weather-affected planning meeting.”

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Better. Blame rain. Rain is non-partisan.

The team builds a minimalist response grid:

1. acknowledge optics
2. avoid theatre
3. answer substance first
4. stop workshop language immediately

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** We also need to kill the phrase “narrative spring clean.”

**SPAD:** Already buried.

**COMMS LEAD:** Not buried enough. It’s on a tote bag.

## CLIMAX

Live doorstep interview under relentless rain.

**JOURNALIST:** Minister, was this offsite a PR stunt?

**MINISTER:** No. It was a working session in difficult weather.

**JOURNALIST:** Why the branded ponchos?

**MINISTER:** Procurement error.

**JOURNALIST:** Why did your team workshop “performative sincerity” on camera?

**MINISTER:** That phrase is no longer in service.

Behind camera, comms staff nod like survivors spotting a rescue helicopter.

The clip airs nationally. Commentary headline:

**“Government Discovers Honesty, Immediately Put on Hold by Rain.”**

---

## TAG

Late evening. The offsite room is empty except for one humming dehumidifier and a forgotten flipchart.

The final line, handwritten and underlined twice:

**"Just say what happened."**

**SPAD (reading it):** Do we have clearance to use this?

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Tomorrow. After legal confirms weather counts as an external factor.

Thunder again.

**END**
