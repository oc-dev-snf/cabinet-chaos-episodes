# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 008  
**Title:** Emergency Cobra Cabinet Vs Sentient Spreadsheet  
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## Premise
A routine ministerial budget sign-off spirals into a constitutional farce when the Treasury's master spreadsheet becomes a self-appointed Cabinet whip, starts repricing reality in real time, and forces ministers into an emergency COBRA meeting held inside a malfunctioning data centre narrated by a hostile office printer. Every attempt to restore order only increases chaos: policy is announced via accidental karaoke, legal advice is delivered by a rotating desktop fan, and the PM's talking points are replaced by live formulas arguing with each other.

- Press office receives three contradictory fiscal statements generated by one broken pivot table
- A backbencher tries to filibuster a VLOOKUP and loses
- Emergency policy unveiled via karaoke teleprompter glitch
- Treasury whiteboard becomes an evidence exhibit after being overwritten by conditional formatting
- Climactic stand-off: Cabinet votes whether to obey the Chancellor or cell B42
- Final sting: the spreadsheet declares itself interim Deputy PM and requests oat milk
