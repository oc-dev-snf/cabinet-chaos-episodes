# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 001  
**Title:** Optics Volcano

## Cold Open
Phones are already ringing like fire alarms in hell. TV ticker screams:
"GOVERNMENT PILOT APP LEAKS 12,000 USER MOODS".

Dan Rucker storms in and demands a line, a fallback line, and a line for when that line catches fire.

## Act One
- Minister Julia Fenwick learns her "harmless" app looks like mood surveillance.
- PM office tries to force a confidence line while avoiding accountability.
- Live media round introduces the phrase: "personally targeted by mood scoring".

## Act Two
- Committee hearing spirals.
- Julia admits the pilot overreached and pauses it.
- Dan explodes because reality has entered the communications plan.

## Act Three
- Number Ten insists on non-apology apology language.
- Named independent reviewer briefly says they were never asked.
- Emergency statement cycle begins.

## Climax
At press conference Julia says: "I am accountable."
Room changes instantly from jeering to listening.
Dan calls it either leadership or career sudoku.

## Tag
Team survives the day. Barely.
"Emotional friction indexing" is retired forever and replaced with:
"absolutely never again."
