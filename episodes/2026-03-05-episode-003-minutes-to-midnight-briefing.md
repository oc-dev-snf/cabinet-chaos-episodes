## COLD OPEN – INT. MINISTER’S KITCHEN – 6:41 AM

Julia is in slippers, on speakerphone, while toast burns.

**DAN (phone):**
Do not read your inbox.

**JULIA:**
I’m reading my inbox.

**DAN:**
Then prepare to meet hell in PDF format.

**JULIA:**
Why is there a leaked draft called “Emergency Public Messaging Containment Grid”?

**DAN:**
Because someone named files like a Bond villain intern.

## ACT ONE

### SCENE 1 – INT. DSS INCIDENT ROOM – 8:09 AM

A crisis drill document has leaked and the public thinks it’s an actual plan for imminent disaster.

**NINA:**
People are stockpiling batteries.

**TOM:**
For what?

**NINA:**
For vibes.

**DAN:**
Good. National panic because we can’t name files like adults.

Leo arrives from Number Ten.

**LEO:**
PM says calm language only.

**DAN:**
PM says calm because PM isn’t currently fielding calls from breakfast TV asking if we’re rationing oxygen.

### SCENE 2 – INT. NEWS STUDIO – 9:02 AM

Julia tries to reassure.

**JULIA:**
This was a routine preparedness exercise.

**HOST:**
Preparedness for what exactly?

**JULIA:**
For scenarios.

**HOST:**
Which scenarios?

**JULIA:**
Various—

**HOST:**
So there are scenarios.

**JULIA:**
There are always scenarios.

Clip immediately reframed online as: **“Minister confirms scenarios.”**

## ACT TWO

### SCENE 3 – INT. COMMS BULLPEN – 11:18 AM

Dan writes giant words on whiteboard:

**“NO MYSTERY. NO DRAMA. NO ACRONYMS.”**

**TOM:**
Can we at least keep one acronym?

**DAN:**
No. Acronyms are where accountability goes to hide.

Nina holds up draft statement:

> “Cross-departmental resilience harmonisation remains active.”

Dan stares like he’s seen a ghost writing consultant.

**DAN:**
That sentence should be arrested.

### SCENE 4 – INT. NUMBER TEN CORRIDOR – 12:52 PM

Leo wants to bury story under unrelated announcement.

**LEO:**
We can launch the parks fund early.

**DAN:**
You can’t bury fear with benches, Leo.

**LEO:**
You can if the benches are regional.

**DAN:**
That is the most Number Ten sentence I have ever heard.

## ACT THREE

### SCENE 5 – INT. SELECT COMMITTEE ANTECHAMBER – 2:11 PM

Committee requests all contingency docs.

**TOM:**
If they read the annexes we’re done.

**NINA:**
Why?

**TOM:**
One annex title is “Public Reassurance Cadence: Fear Dampening.”

**NINA:**
Who wrote that?

**TOM:**
People who have never spoken to humans.

### SCENE 6 – INT. MINISTER’S OFFICE – 3:04 PM

Julia decides to front-foot.

**JULIA:**
We publish the drill docs ourselves.

**DAN:**
Absolutely not.

**JULIA:**
With plain-English notes beside each section.

**DAN:**
…that is horrifyingly sensible.

**JULIA:**
Exactly. Let’s do one competent thing before sunset.

---

## CLIMAX – INT. PRESS ROOM – 4:37 PM

Julia announces publication of exercise docs with clear public explainer.

**JULIA:**
Preparedness plans exist so emergencies *don’t* become chaos. We train so we don’t panic.

**JOURNALIST:**
So no active emergency?

**JULIA:**
No active emergency.

**JOURNALIST:**
Why was the file called “containment grid”?

**JULIA:**
Because we are now auditing every filename in government.

Room laughs. Tension breaks.

Dan mutters:

**DAN:**
We’re one typo away from civil unrest and I hate this job.

---

## TAG – INT. OPEN PLAN – 6:33 PM

Nina updates guidance doc title to:

**“How Not To Name Things Like A Lunatic”**

Dan sees it.

**DAN:**
Approved.

**TOM:**
That’s not official formatting.

**DAN:**
It is now.

**END**
