## COLD OPEN – INT. DEPARTMENT FOR SOCIAL STABILITY (DSS) – OPEN PLAN – 7:42 AM

Phones are already ringing like fire alarms in hell. A giant TV shows rolling news:
**"GOVERNMENT PILOT APP LEAKS 12,000 USER MOODS"**

**NINA (Junior SpAd, panicking):**
Why is it saying “mood data”? We don’t collect mood data, do we?

**TOM (Policy adviser, sleep-deprived):**
Technically it’s called “Emotional Friction Indexing.”

**NINA:**
That sounds worse. That sounds like we’re sorting citizens by sadness.

**TOM:**
No, no, it’s wellbeing-adjacent.

**NINA:**
“Adjacent” to prison is still prison, Tom.

Lift dings. In storms **DAN RUCKER**, Director of Communications: immaculate suit, bloodshot eyes, carrying three coffees and one existential collapse.

**DAN:**
Right, who built the app that now looks like we’ve created Spotify Wrapped for depression?

Silence.

**DAN (clocking screen):**
Brilliant. We’re in the headlines before breakfast. That’s governance now, is it?
Step one: invent policy.
Step two: leak policy.
Step three: deny policy while standing in front of policy.

**NINA:**
Minister’s car is six minutes out.

**DAN:**
Then in six minutes I want a line, a fallback line, and a line if that line catches fire.

**TOM:**
What about: “No individual-level data was exposed”?

**DAN:**
Great, and when they ask if group-level data was exposed?

**TOM:**
…yes?

**DAN:**
Fantastic. We’ll reassure the public by confirming we only leaked them in bulk.

## ACT ONE

### SCENE 1 – INT. MINISTER’S OFFICE – 8:03 AM

**MINISTER JULIA FENWICK** enters with false calm and real terror.

**JULIA:**
Morning. Why is my husband texting me “Did you invent a feelings database?”

**DAN:**
Because the story’s out and your husband can read.

**JULIA:**
I was told this app was harmless.

**TOM:**
It is harmless-ish. The leak was from the pilot vendor mirror, not core system.

**JULIA:**
That sentence just gave me hives. Translate.

**DAN:**
A subcontractor left a window open and now we look like we’ve been mining people’s despair for KPI points.

**JULIA:**
Can we shut it down?

**TOM:**
Technically yes, politically maybe not. PM’s office wanted it as flagship “modern state” material.

**DAN:**
Flagship? It’s the bloody Titanic with analytics.

Phone buzzes. Dan reads message and exhales like a dying radiator.

**DAN:**
Media round brought forward. You’re live in thirty-nine minutes.

**JULIA:**
No.

**DAN:**
Yes.

### SCENE 2 – INT. PM PRESS GRID CORRIDOR – 8:40 AM

Dan corners **LEO BARNETT** from PM’s office. Leo smiles like a man who outsources blame professionally.

**LEO:**
Bad morning?

**DAN:**
Your people signed this pilot.

**LEO:**
Your department procured it.

**DAN:**
Your strategist named it “Pulse of the Nation.”

**LEO:**
Strong name.

**DAN:**
Strong name? It sounds like a dystopian blood pressure monitor.

**LEO:**
Look, Number Ten wants this contained. No admissions of negligence.

**DAN:**
Fine. We’ll call it an “unauthorised enthusiasm for data transparency.”

**LEO:**
Good. Also PM wants Julia to say she has “full confidence in digital reform.”

**DAN:**
Tell PM I have full confidence in gravity, doesn’t mean I jump off roofs.

### SCENE 3 – INT. TV STUDIO BACKSTAGE – 9:11 AM

Julia in makeup chair. Dan crouched beside her, rapid-fire briefing.

**DAN:**
Three points:
One, “small pilot.”
Two, “no payment data.”
Three, “independent review today.”

**JULIA:**
And if they ask who approved emotional indexing?

**DAN:**
Say: “Framework decisions were collective.”

**JULIA:**
Collective means no one and everyone. That’s cowardly.

**DAN:**
Exactly. You’re learning.

Producer counts down.

**PRODUCER:**
You’re live in ten… nine…

**JULIA (whisper):**
If this goes wrong, I’m blaming you.

**DAN:**
Get in line.

---

## ACT TWO

### SCENE 4 – INT. DSS OPEN PLAN – 10:02 AM

Staff watch replay. Julia did fine until one question.

TV clip:

**JOURNALIST (on screen):**
Did your department profile vulnerable users by emotional state?

**JULIA (on screen):**
No citizen was personally targeted by mood scoring.

Open plan collectively winces.

**NINA:**
“Personally targeted by mood scoring” is now trending.

**TOM:**
Could trend worse.

**NINA:**
It is worse. Hashtag is “#MoodPolice.”

Dan pinches bridge of nose.

**DAN:**
Right. We need a diversion.

**TOM:**
Like what?

**DAN:**
Something boring and expensive. Treasury statement? Rail procurement? Anything with spreadsheets so dense journalists lose the will to breathe.

### SCENE 5 – INT. SELECT COMMITTEE HOLDING ROOM – 11:27 AM

Committee hearing summoned at speed. Julia, Dan, Tom seated.
Across from them: **CHAIR MP HARPER**, weaponised politeness.

**CHAIR:**
Minister, did your department collect psychological indicators?

**JULIA:**
We collected user feedback markers for service optimisation.

**CHAIR:**
Is that a yes?

**JULIA:**
It is a contextual yes.

**CHAIR:**
There is no contextual yes, Minister. There is yes, no, and whatever this is.

Tom slides a note: **“BLAME PROCUREMENT CHAIN.”**

Julia ignores it.

**JULIA:**
The pilot overreached. We are suspending it.

Dan jolts.

**DAN (hissed):**
You what?

**JULIA (low):**
I’m not dying on a hill made of app metrics.

Harper smells blood.

**CHAIR:**
So this was approved, launched, and only paused after public exposure?

**JULIA:**
We acted swiftly once informed.

**CHAIR:**
By the newspaper.

### SCENE 6 – INT. STAIRWELL – 12:06 PM

Dan and Julia in furious whisper-shout.

**DAN:**
You just admitted failure on live committee feed!

**JULIA:**
I admitted reality. It’s novel.

**DAN:**
Reality is for memoirs, not Wednesdays!

**JULIA:**
Your strategy was to deny nouns until sunset.

**DAN:**
That is called communications discipline.

**JULIA:**
It’s called lying with posture.

Beat.

**DAN (quieter):**
If PM decides this is your fault, you’re gone by tea.

**JULIA:**
Then maybe stop feeding Number Ten the fantasy that everything’s under control when it’s held together by interns and prayer.

Dan almost smiles.

**DAN:**
…that was annoyingly good.

---

## ACT THREE

### SCENE 7 – INT. PM OFFICE SATELLITE ROOM – 1:15 PM

Leo, Dan, two civil servants, one giant crisis doc.

**LEO:**
PM wants a joint statement by two o’clock.

**DAN:**
Fine. We need apology, action, and audit.

**LEO:**
No apology. Too legal.

**DAN:**
No apology means we look soulless.

**LEO:**
We are soulless. We just can’t print it.

Civil servant timidly raises hand.

**CIVIL SERVANT:**
Could we say “We regret concern caused”?

Room goes still.

**DAN:**
“We regret concern caused” is bureaucratic for “Sorry you noticed.” No.

### SCENE 8 – INT. NEWSROOM SATELLITE FEED – 2:03 PM

Joint statement goes out.
Ticker: **“MINISTER PAUSES APP PILOT, ORDERS INDEPENDENT REVIEW.”**

Not great, not fatal.

Then Nina runs in, pale.

**NINA:**
New problem. The independent reviewer you named just tweeted: “I was not asked.”

Silence.

**DAN:**
Of course. Of course the one plank of competence was imaginary.

### SCENE 9 – INT. MINISTER’S OFFICE – 2:31 PM

Julia dictates emergency video statement.

**JULIA:**
“Today I am commissioning—”

**DAN:**
No, not “commissioning.” Sounds fake now.

Phone pings. Dan checks, stunned.

**DAN:**
Wait. Reviewer has deleted tweet. New tweet says “Initial confusion now resolved.”

**TOM:**
So we’re okay?

**DAN:**
No, we’re in government. “Okay” is not a state we visit.

## CLIMAX

### SCENE 10 – INT. PRESS ROOM – 4:00 PM

Packed room. Julia at podium. Dan side-stage like bomb disposal.

**JULIA:**
This pilot went beyond what the public should reasonably expect. I have paused it, commissioned an independent review, and issued new data governance instructions today.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Who is accountable?

Julia glances at Dan.

**JULIA:**
I am.

Room snaps into attention.

**JOURNALIST 2:**
Will anyone resign?

**JULIA:**
I’m focused on fixing the problem, not performing theatre for headlines.

**JOURNALIST 3:**
Did Number Ten pressure you to launch early?

Beat.

**JULIA:**
This department made the decision. This department is fixing it.

**DAN (under breath):**
That was either leadership or career sudoku.

## TAG

### SCENE 11 – INT. DSS OPEN PLAN – 6:12 PM

Crisis has moved from inferno to smoulder.

**NINA:**
Public sentiment’s weirdly improved.

**TOM:**
Because she admitted fault?

**NINA:**
Apparently people like honesty.

Dan enters with takeaway bags.

**DAN:**
Lesson learned: transparency works occasionally and I hate that. Eat carbs.

**JULIA (from doorway):**
And we retire the phrase “emotional friction indexing.”

**DAN:**
Already done. It’s now called “absolutely never again.”

**END**
