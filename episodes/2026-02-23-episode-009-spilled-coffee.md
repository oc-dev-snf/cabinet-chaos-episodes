---

## Premise
A minister spills coffee over a confidential briefing pack moments before a major announcement, and the attempt to hide one small accident escalates into a full-spectrum government panic involving fake printouts, contradictory talking points, and a tragic national photo-op with a damp policy document.

## COLD OPEN – INT. DEPARTMENT PRESS BULLPEN – 7:41 AM

A junior aide, LEON, sprints through desks carrying two coffees and a folder stamped **"URGENT – FINAL FINAL"**.

He clips a cable.

Coffee launches in a perfect arc. It lands directly on the briefing folder.

**LEON:**
No. No no no no no.

Ink blooms across page one. A headline now reads:

> **"FIVE POINT PLAN"** → **"FIVE POINT PAN"**

**JULIA:**
Tell me that’s decaf.

**LEON:**
It was confidence roast.

**DAN (entering):**
Why does this room smell like panic and Brazil?

He sees the soaked folder.

**DAN:**
Right. Nobody moves. Nobody admits. Nobody says "spill" near a microphone ever again.

## ACT ONE – INT. WAR ROOM – 8:18 AM

The team spreads damp pages under hand dryers.

**NINA:**
Page three is gone.

**DAN:**
What was page three?

**NINA:**
The only coherent bit.

**DAN:**
Fine. We’ll invent coherence.

They print emergency replacements from old drafts. One says **"tax relief"**, another says **"targeted levy"**.

### SCENE 2 – INT. MINISTERIAL OFFICE – 8:44 AM

MINISTER FELTON rehearses lines.

**FELTON:**
"This plan is watertight."

Everyone freezes.

**JULIA:**
Maybe avoid water metaphors.

Leon silently wrings out a lanyard.

**DAN:**
From now on: "robust," "resilient," "dry." Especially dry.

## ACT TWO – INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM – 10:03 AM

Journalists assemble. A camera zooms toward Felton’s lectern notes. A damp corner droops visibly.

**REPORTER 1:**
Minister, is that document wet?

**FELTON:**
No, that’s… reflective governance.

A page detaches and flops to the floor.

**REPORTER 2:**
Why does your policy have latte foam on it?

Backstage, Dan whispers through clenched teeth.

**DAN:**
Say it’s prototype paper.

**FELTON:**
This is sustainable cellulose responding to stakeholder heat.

Murmurs turn to laughter.

### SCENE 2 – INT. SOCIAL MEDIA MONITOR DESK – 10:27 AM

Hashtag **#SpillThePlan** trends nationally.

A viral still shows Felton holding a warped page reading:

> **"NATIONAL GROWT H"**

**NINA:**
They’re calling it cappuccino economics.

**DAN:**
Good. Better than fraud.

**LEON:**
Should I confess?

**DAN:**
No. In this building confession is premium content.

## ACT THREE – INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM – 11:11 AM

Senior officials demand answers.

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:**
Was this simple incompetence or strategic beverage deployment?

**DAN:**
It was a dynamic hydration event.

**SECRETARY:**
That is not a phrase.

**DAN:**
It is now.

### SCENE 2 – INT. PHOTO-OP STAGE – 11:36 AM

Felton attempts a reset with a staged signing ceremony.

A pristine replacement document is brought in.

Leon, carrying yet another coffee, trips on the same cable.

Time slows.

Second spill. Direct hit.

A collective gasp.

**JULIA (quietly):**
That’s… actually tragic.

Flashbulbs explode.

## CLIMAX – INT. EMERGENCY COMMS HUDDLE – 12:04 PM

Dan delivers final instructions.

**DAN:**
Right. New line: We delayed publication to improve clarity.

**NINA:**
After two public soakings?

**DAN:**
Yes. Call it iterative transparency.

**LEON:**
I can resign.

**DAN:**
No. You’re now "Head of Liquid Risk." You’re too valuable.

Julia checks her phone.

**JULIA:**
PM spokesperson says: "Government remains focused, despite minor coffee-related optics."

**DAN:**
Minor? We’ve lost a fiscal strategy to Arabica.

---

## TAG – INT. OFFICE KITCHEN – 6:22 PM

A new laminated sign hangs above the kettle:

> **"NO BEVERAGES WITHIN 3 METRES OF POLICY"**

Leon reaches for the coffee machine. Everyone stares.

He slowly picks up a bottle of water instead.

The bottle cap slips. Water sprays over tomorrow’s briefing folder.

Silence.

**DAN (off):**
I’m taking the train to Belgium and never coming back.

**END**
