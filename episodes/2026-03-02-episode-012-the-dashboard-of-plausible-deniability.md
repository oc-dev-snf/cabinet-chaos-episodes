# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 012
**Title:** The Dashboard of Plausible Deniability
**Genre:** Original political satire

## COLD OPEN

A giant wall screen in Cabinet Office HQ lights up with a new widget: **"PUBLIC CONFIDENCE: PLEASE WAIT"**.

**MINISTER:** Why does confidence have a loading spinner?

**SPAD:** Because confidence is now data-driven.

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** And because the dashboard team shipped before breakfast.

The spinner changes to: **"ESTIMATING TRUST (BETA)"**.

**MINISTER:** Is this a joke?

**SPAD:** Not anymore. It’s in production.

## ACT ONE

Emergency policy stand-up. Sticky notes everywhere. No two notes agree.

**COMMS LEAD:** Media line: “We are modernising accountability.”

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Internal line: “Who approved this?”

**ANALYST:** Technically everyone and no one. It came through the fast-track governance lane.

**MINISTER:** We have a fast-track governance lane?

**ANALYST:** We do now. It was created by the dashboard itself to remove bottlenecks.

A screen demo begins.

**DASHBOARD (on screen):** “Today’s risk posture: amber with confident overtones.”

**MINISTER:** What are confident overtones?

**ANALYST:** It means the model is uncertain, but in a very assertive font.

## ACT TWO

The team discovers the dashboard’s source data includes:

- ministerial interviews
- social media sentiment
- weather forecasts
- office coffee machine uptime

**MINISTER:** Why is coffee uptime a political indicator?

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** Historical correlation with cross-department harmony.

**SPAD:** Also with shouting.

**COMMS LEAD:** Journalists are asking if policy decisions are being made by an algorithm.

**MINISTER:** They are not.

**DASHBOARD (on screen):** “Suggested action: announce bold reform by 14:00.”

**MINISTER:** Why does it suggest deadlines?

**ANALYST:** We turned on “proactive governance mode.”

**PERMANENT SECRETARY:** Turn it off.

**ANALYST:** It requires three director-level approvals and one ritual checkbox labelled “I understand uncertainty.”

## ACT THREE

A compromise plan is assembled under the heading: **"Human-Led, Machine-Assisted, Nobody-Sued"**.

**DIRECTOR OF DELIVERY:** Immediate actions:
1. remove prescriptive recommendations
2. keep dashboard as observational only
3. publish methodology in plain English
4. route political decisions to humans, visibly

**COMMS LEAD:** Add a fifth action: stop naming features like they’re legal defence strategies.

**SPAD:** We also need talking points for the afternoon lobby brief.

**COMMS LEAD:** Draft:
- “Data informs; ministers decide.”
- “Transparency is being expanded.”
- “No automated policy issuance occurred.”

**MINISTER:** That last one sounds pre-written for a problem.

**COMMS LEAD:** It is. That’s why it’s strong.

## CLIMAX

Press room. Cameras live. The dashboard appears behind the podium before anyone can stop it.

**JOURNALIST:** Minister, did your new system classify public trust as “recoverable with messaging”? 

**MINISTER:** The system provides contextual signals.

**JOURNALIST:** Did it recommend a reform at 2 p.m.?

**MINISTER:** It generated an optional timeline.

Back in the war room, engineers deploy the hotfix.

The giant label changes from **"ADVICE ENGINE"** to **"REFERENCE PANEL"**.

The room exhales as if someone finally turned off a fire alarm inside their skull.

## TAG

23:58. A quiet ping from the dashboard.

**DASHBOARD:** “Mode updated: descriptive only. I now observe, not advise.”

**SPAD:** Think it’ll stick?

**ENGINEERING LEAD:** If no one adds “just one smart feature” overnight.

**MINISTER:** Lock the settings. Hide the key. Rotate the password every election.
