# THE THICK OF ITCH

**Episode:** 005  
**Title:** Minister Pedal Power Green Transport Gaffe  
**Genre:** Original political satire

---

## Premise
Following a government push on “active travel,” the Minister announces a flagship cycling infrastructure initiative intended to win over younger voters and urban commuters. Unfortunately, he hasn’t ridden a bike in 25 years, doesn’t understand how cycle lanes work, and accidentally insults both motorists and cyclists in the same morning broadcast round. As the department scrambles to spin the narrative, a pilot launch in Edinburgh descends into chaos when the Minister’s staged cycle commute goes catastrophically wrong — all while a funding shortfall and leaked WhatsApp messages threaten to derail the policy before lunchtime.

## COLD OPEN – INT. TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT COMMS FLOOR – 7:12 AM

A red marker squeals across a whiteboard: **“MESSAGING FOR ACTIVE TRAVEL LAUNCH.”**

Dan Rucker reads the draft line out loud and physically recoils.

**DAN:**
“Bikes are basically slow cars.” Who wrote that and why do they hate oxygen?

**SPAD #1:**
It tested well with motorists.

**DAN:**
At Nuremberg maybe.

Julia Fenwick enters with coffee and dread.

**JULIA:**
Please tell me this is satire.

**NINA:**
No. It’s the approved opening paragraph.

Dan rips the page off the board.

**DAN:**
Right. New rule. We are pro-cyclist, pro-driver, and anti-stupidity. In that order.

## ACT ONE – INT. DEPARTMENT FORECOURT – 8:03 AM

Branded backdrop: **PEDAL BRITAIN: MOVE SMARTER.**

A press pack gathers while the Minister, Grant Belling, stares at a city bike like it’s unexploded ordnance.

**GRANT BELLING:**
This seat is… high.

**NINA (quiet):**
It’s at minimum height.

Grant attempts to mount. Misses. Attempts again. Misses harder.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Minister, are you comfortable with urban cycling infrastructure?

**GRANT (sweating):**
Very. Hugely. Deeply comfortable.

He finally gets on, wobbles two metres, and slams one shoe into a planter.

**DAN (through clenched teeth):**
No one film the planter.

### SCENE 2 – LIVE RADIO ROUND – 8:41 AM

Grant joins breakfast radio from a car he insisted was “more practical for optics.”

**HOST:**
Minister, what do you say to cyclists asking for safer lanes?

**GRANT:**
Well, everyone’s got to pay their way, and some cyclists can feel a bit… road-tax adjacent.

Comms room goes silent.

**NINA:**
He did not just say “road-tax adjacent.”

**TOM:**
Twitter says he called them “road tax dodgers.”

**DAN:**
Fantastic. We’ve launched green transport by declaring war on legs.

## ACT TWO – INT. WAR ROOM – 9:15 AM

Dan slaps a fresh heading on screen:

**“REBRAND IN 40 MINUTES.”**

**JULIA:**
Can we keep “Pedal Britain”?

**NINA:**
No. It’s trending with bin-fire emojis.

**TOM:**
Suggestion: “Move Britain.”

**DAN:**
Good. Neutral. No one gets offended by a verb.

### SCENE 2 – BUDGET REALITY – 9:38 AM

A civil servant, Priya, enters with a spreadsheet and the expression of a coroner.

**PRIYA:**
Small issue. The allocated pilot budget funds approximately four hundred metres of cycle lane.

**JULIA:**
Four hundred metres?

**PRIYA:**
Depending on paint thickness.

**DAN:**
So we’ve announced a national transformation with enough cash to circle a retail park.

### SCENE 3 – WHATSAPP LEAK – 10:12 AM

Nina drops her phone on the table.

**NINA:**
Voice note leaked. Minister says, quote, “Men in Lycra are not my core electorate.”

**TOM:**
Oh no.

**DAN:**
No, no — this is good. Nothing calms a policy launch like class warfare in activewear.

## ACT THREE – EXT. EDINBURGH PILOT LAUNCH – 11:26 AM

Torrential rain. Wind so violent the podium banner folds itself into modern art.

Grant, in oversized hi-vis, prepares for a staged commute.

**JOURNALIST 2:**
Minister, can you clarify your remarks about cyclists?

**GRANT:**
Taken out of context. I support all forms of responsible mobility.

He pushes off, immediately drifts sideways, and is clipped by a Deliveroo rider threading through traffic.

Grant falls in slow motion into a puddle the size of policy regret.

**DAN (to camera team):**
If this footage airs, I’m legally changing my name.

### SCENE 2 – SELECT COMMITTEE AMBUSH – 12:08 PM

Screenshots are printed, laminated, weaponised.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
Minister, did you call cyclists “road tax dodgers” and “men in Lycra” in private messages?

**GRANT:**
Those were informal remarks.

**CHAIR HARPER:**
You are currently Transport Minister. You are never informal.

Dan watches from the back row, spiritually leaving the building.

### SCENE 3 – PRESS OFFICE MELTDOWN – 12:27 PM

Five different holding lines are accidentally emailed:

1. “Comments misinterpreted”  
2. “Minister regrets phrasing”  
3. “Policy unaffected by weather incident”  
4. “No collision occurred”  
5. “Photo-op successful”

**NINA:**
We just denied the same event in three different tenses.

**DAN:**
Fine. New line: “Human being had bad day in rain.” Send that.

## CLIMAX – EXT. CITY CENTRE – 1:04 PM

Damage-control commute relaunch.

There are no suitable bikes left. A local campaigner offers a tiny child’s bike with streamers.

**CAMPAIGNER:**
If he wants to prove commitment, he can pedal this to the station.

Grant looks at Dan. Dan looks at polling data. Julia nods once.

**DAN:**
Do it. Dignity is already dead.

Grant pedals five humiliating blocks on a child’s bike while cameras roll, soaked and grim.

Crowd reactions split between laughter and reluctant sympathy.

**JOURNALIST 1:**
Minister, is this your new active-travel symbol?

**GRANT (breathless):**
It is… a practical demonstration… of adaptable mobility.

### PRESS RECOVERY LINE – 1:19 PM

Julia steps in front of the microphones.

**JULIA:**
Today’s rollout was messy, and that’s on us. The policy still matters. We’ll republish the plan at 4 PM with real costs, real phasing, and fewer slogans.

Unexpectedly, the room settles.

**NINA (to Dan):**
That actually landed.

**DAN:**
Truth again. We’ll have to ban it before it catches on.

---

## TAG – INT. DEPARTMENT BASEMENT GARAGE – 6:02 PM

Grant signs a briefing note titled: **“MOVE BRITAIN – V2.”**

He eyes the child’s bike parked beside his ministerial car.

**GRANT:**
Can we quietly dispose of that?

Dan sticks a “Pool Bike” label on it.

**DAN:**
No. It’s now departmental heritage.

Nina adds it to the asset register.

**NINA:**
Category: Strategic Transport Demonstrator.

Dan raises a vending machine coffee.

**DAN:**
To green policy, bad weather, and the death of spin.

**END**
